## 电影

<music id="1497071430" />

2022 年中大陆的电影市场依然没有掀起什么波澜，年初的春节档竟然延迟上映到 6 月底。没有办法的吃老本吧。

上周末回顾了诺兰导演的盗梦空间、星际穿越、禁闭岛。

电影星际穿越是一部成功的科幻片，更感动我的其实是它所关于爱的承诺。

杨紫琼主演的电影，《妈的多重宇宙》设定很有意思。可惜没在国内上映。电影是造梦的艺术，好的原创电影值得被看见。

## Vue 周边

Evan You 又怼人了，I like this man,hhh. 服务提供者有权利拒绝服务。

> Hey, nobody asked you to use it and you didn't pay for it either. As a user, the very least you can do is to communicate in a respectful and constructive manner, yet you failed to do that. The complexity of types in the source code is there to provide better intellisense for day-to-day usage, which is an obvious trade-off. You are projecting your frustration with your own incompetence in TypeScript on to the author of the library that is trying to help you for free. You are the embodiment of open source consumer entitlement and you are welcome to fuck off and never use this library again.

> P.S. you have been banned from interacting with any repositories under the vuejs organization, forever. Please don't bother replying. Actually, I believe it'd be much better off if you just stop using open source and write everything yourself from scratch!
